# ToothFairy Algorithm ADaS lab
This code pertains to the algorithm presented by Vicent Caselles of the ADaS (Applied DAta Sciences) lab from UOC (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya), based in Barcelona. This agorithm is implemented using `Python` and a suite of apps commonly used in Neuroimaging such as `niftyseg` and `fsl`.

Our approach follows a triplanar nnUNet approach, implemented thanks to the wonderful work conducted by _Isensee et al. (2021)_.
